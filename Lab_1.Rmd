#Exercise 1
```{r}
x<- 3
y<-15
x+y
y-x
x*y
y/x
```
#Exercise 2
#For x = 2 and y = 3, Test x^5 is greater than y^4 and return a logical value
```{r}
x<-2
y<-3
x^5>y^4
```
#Exercise 3
#Create a vector of the values 22, 62, 148, 43 and 129. Determine the sum of the vector. Divide each value in the vector by the sum to determine relate frequency.
```{r}
num <- c(22, 62, 148, 43, 129)
sum(num)
num/sum(num)
```
#Exercise 4
#Create a vector of the nucleotides A, T, C and G. Sort the vector
```{r}
nucleotides <- c("A", "T", "C","G")
sort(nucleotides)
```
