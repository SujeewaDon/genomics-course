```{r}
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")

```

Challenge-1

Using pipes, subset the surveys data to include animals collected before 1995 and
retain only the columns year , sex , and weight .

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  filter(year < 1995) %>% 
  select(year , sex , weight)
```

Challenge-2

Create a new data frame from the surveys data that meets the following criteria:
contains only the species_id column and a new column called hindfoot_cm
containing the hindfoot_length values converted to centimeters. In this
hindfoot_cm column, there are no NA s and all values are less than 3.
Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

```{r}
new_surveys <- surveys %>% 
                mutate("hindfoot_cm"=hindfoot_length)
```
