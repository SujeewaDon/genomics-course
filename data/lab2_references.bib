abstract = {Tumor progression and the immune response are intricately linked. While it is known that cancers alter macrophage inflammatory responses to promote tumor progression, little is known regarding how cancers affect macrophage-dependent innate host defense. In this study, murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were exposed to murine carcinoma- conditioned media prior to assessment of the macrophage inflammatory response. BMDMs exposed to 4T1 mammary carcinoma-conditioned medium demonstrated enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$, interleukin-6, and CCL2 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while production of interleukin-10 remained unchanged. The increased LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was transient and correlated with enhanced cytokine production in response to other Toll-like receptor agonists, including peptidoglycan and flagellin. In addition, 4T1-conditioned BMDMs exhibited strengthened LPS-induced nitric oxide production and enhanced phagocytosis of Escherichia coli. 4T1-mediated augmentation of macrophage responses to LPS was partially dependent on the NF$\kappa$B pathway, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and actin polymerization, as well as the presence of 4T1-secreted extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages obtained from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice displayed enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to LPS. These results suggest that uptake of 4T1-secreted factors and actin-mediated ingestion of 4T1-secreted exosomes by macrophages cause a transient enhancement of innate inflammatory responses. Mammary carcinoma-mediated regulation of innate immunity may have significant implications for our understanding of host defense and cancer progression. Copyright:},

abstract = {We present here an integrated nanotechnology/biology strategy for cancer immunotherapy that uses arginine nanoparticles (ArgNPs) to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing machinery into cells to generate SIRP-$\alpha$ knockout macrophages. The NP system efficiently codelivers single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein required for editing to knock out the "don't eat me signal" in macrophages that prevents phagocytosis of cancer cells. Turning off this signal increased the innate phagocytic capabilities of the macrophages by 4-fold. This improved attack and elimination of cancer cells makes this strategy promising for the creation of "weaponized" macrophages for cancer immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone sarcoma in adolescents, and has poor prognosis. A vicious cycle is established between OS cells and their microenvironment in order to facilitate the tumor growth and cell spreading. The present work aims to better characterize the tumor microenvironment in OS in order to identify new therapeutic targets relating to metastatic process. Tissue microarrays of pre-chemotherapy OS biopsies were used for characterizing the tumor niche by immunohistochemistry. Parameters studies included: immune cells (M1, M2-subtypes of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM); T, B lymphocytes; mast cells), vascularization (endothelial, perivascular cells), OPG, RANKL, and mitotic index. Two groups of patients were defined, 22 localized OS (OS Meta-) and 28 metastatic OS (OS Meta+). The OS Meta- group was characterized by a higher infiltration of INOS+ M1-polarized macrophages and upregulated OPG immunostaining. OS Meta+ tumors showed a significant increase in CD146+ cells. INOS+ M1-macrophages were correlated with OPG staining, and negatively with the presence of metastases. CD163+ M2-macrophages were positively correlated with CD146+ cells. In multivariate analysis, INOS and OPG were predictive factors for metastasis. An older age, non-metastatic tumor, good response to chemotherapy, and higher macrophage infiltration were significantly associated with better overall survival. TAMs are associated with better overall survival and a dysregulation of M1/M2 polarized-macrophages in favor of M1 subtype was observed in non-metastatic OS.},

abstract = {Tumor-associated macrophages and their alternative activation states together with cytokines and growth factors trapped in tumor microenvironment contribute to the progression of OS. In contrast to other tumor types, M2 polarized macrophages, reduce metastasis and improve survival in osteosarcoma patients. Mifamurtide is an immunomodulatory drug given together with standard adjuvant chemotherapy in high-grade osteosarcoma to improve outcome. Macrophages obtained from peripheral blood mononucleated cells of healthy donors and MG63 cells were cultured alone and together, and treated with Mifamurtide. We analyzed the effects of Mifamurtide on macrophage polarization and on MG63 proliferation, migration and differentiation, evaluating the expression of M1/M2 and osteoblast markers and molecules involved in metastasis and proliferation pathways. Our data suggest that Mifamurtide, switching macrophage polarization towards a TAM-like intermediate M1/M2 phenotype, may modulate the delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory macrophage functions. Moreover, Mifamurtide may inhibit the cellular proliferation and induce the tumor cell differentiation, probably through the down regulation of pSTAT3, pAKT and IL-17R. Copyright: Punzo et al.},
