abstract = {The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development agreed by UN Member States in 2015 will drive global and national policies for the coming fifteen years. Arsenic will feature more prominently in this development agenda, both in terms of direct influence on the target for universal access to safe drinking water, and indirect impacts on the realization of other targets. For states to successfully track progress towards the new targets, surveillance and monitoring systems will need to be strengthened at national and sub-national levels. Development and strengthening of such systems will take many years, and will certainly still be in progress by the end of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030.},
